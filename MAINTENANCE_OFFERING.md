# Maintenance as a Service (MaaS) | Growth Strategy

To maximize your earnings using this system, you should move from "One-off audits" to a **Subscription-Based Maintenance Model**.

## 1. Service Tiers & Pricing Logic

| Tier | Features | Target Client | Monthly Fee (Est.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | Weekly Uptime Monitoring, Monthly Performance Audits, Basic CSS fixes. | Small Care Homes | £149 - £299 |
| **Premium** | Daily Uptime, Bi-weekly Audits, AI-Generated Insight Reports, PWA/Mobile health checks. | Multi-site Groups | £499 - £899 |
| **Enterprise** | Real-time monitoring, Security/SSL alerts, CQC/Compliance document sync, Custom KPI tracking. | Corporate Healthcare | £1,500+ |

## 2. Using the Dashboard to Upsell (Revenue Opportunities)

The system is now configured to identify **"Revenue Opportunities"**.
- **Low Performance Score?** Sell a "Vitals Optimization Package".
- **Broken Uptime?** Sell a "Hosting Migration/Stability Upgrade".
- **Accessibility Issues?** Sell a "Compliance Remediation Project" (Crucial for healthcare).

## 3. High-Value Pain Points (Beyond Performance)

To add extra value, offer these "Add-on" services that the system can help monitor:

1. **The "Regulator Desk" Audit**: 
   - Check if the CQC "Good" rating badge is still present and valid.
   - Monitor if "Privacy Policies" mention the correct year (GDPR Compliance).
   
2. **The "Recruitment Funnel" Guard**:
   - specifically monitor the speed of the "Apply Now" page. If it's over 3s, the client is losing staff candidates (Huge pain point in care).

3. **Visual Drift Detection**:
   - Monthly screenshot comparisons to ensure no "Broken Images" or "Misaligned Headers" appear after browser updates (e.g., Chrome v130+ changes).

## 4. The "Pitch" Slide (Example)

> "We don't just build your site; we guard it. Our Maintenance OS monitors 48 data points daily. When your site slows down or a compliance risk appears, we fix it before you even notice it. You focus on care; we focus on the code."
